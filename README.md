# Used-Cars-Data-Analysis-and-Visualization
In this Jupyter Notebook, I have performed Exploratory Data Analysis and Statistical Analysis on the used cars dataset of an automobile company XYZ. This project was a part of my PGCP-DSML certificate program to show my Data Analysis skills. I hope you will gain some insight from my work.


### About the project
There is a huge demand for used cars in the US Market today. As sales of new cars have slowed down in the recent past, the pre-owned car market has continued to grow over the past years and is larger than the new car market now. XYZ is a budding automobile company that aspires to enter the Used-car market by setting up their company locally to give competition to their counterparts. Some car sellers replace their old cars with pre-owned cars instead of buying new ones. Used cars are very different beasts with huge uncertainty in both pricing and supply. Keeping this in mind, the pricing scheme of these used cars becomes important in order to grow in the market. We have to come up with a pricing model that can effectively predict the price of used cars and can help the business in devising profitable strategies using differential pricing.  

The objective of the project is to discuss the features of used cars with regard to their influence on the market price. Based on such analysis, a model for price prediction could be constructed in order to provide a real-time used car evaluation service. The final product takes features (transmission, owner, fuel, seller_type, etc.) of a used car as input and outputs a prediction of price. Moreover, it should be capable of producing an interval prediction as price range, and it should be able to handle missing features so that the user can make a query even when they are not clear about certain features. As a more ambitious attempt, a recommender system could be built such that we can not only evaluate the price but also recommend features for car search by potential buyers, based on the expected price and desired features.

# Data Description
## Domain:
Automobile Industry
## About:
There is an automobile company XYZ which aspires to enter the Used-car market by setting up their company locally to give competition to their counterparts.
## Challenges:
They want to understand the factors affecting the pricing of cars in the market, since those may be very different from the new car market. Essentially, the company wants to know:
• Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a used car?
• How well those variables describe the price of a car
Based on various market surveys, the consulting firm has gathered a large dataset of different types of used cars across the market.
## Expectations:
Being a data analyst, you must come up with a first-step document that lists the output of your exploratory analysis, any issues or problems you may see with data that need follow-up, and some basic descriptive analysis that you think highlights important outcomes/findings from the data. Based on your findings, the next level of analysis will be charted out.
